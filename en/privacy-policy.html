              <p>1.You represent that you are an authorized User under the Agreement. 
                  If you do not qualify as an authorized User, then you may download 
                  the App, but will not be able to log in.</p>
              <p>2.The Android App Terms of Use is governed by the terms of the 
                  Agreement and any amendment thereto or additional purchase thereunder. 
                  The Android App Terms of Use adjusts and/or supplements certain terms 
                  of the Agreement, solely with respect to the App. Capitalized terms 
                  used but not defined in the Android App Terms of Use have the meanings 
                  given to them in the Agreement.</p>

                  SpeakEng account via the App if: (a) User has a valid and active SpeakEng 
                  User Account; and (b) the administrator of the relevant Customer’s SpeakEng 
                  portal has not disabled use of the App. In this respect, “portal” means an 
                  instance of the SpeakEng Product with a set of Customer Data.</p>
              <p>4.If Customer User uses the App, Customer Data may be transferred to and from 
                  the respective technical infrastructure systems that support SpeakEng, 
                  including servers administered by netAngels Inc. Additional information 
                  regarding these technical infrastructure systems and the rules that apply 
                  to such transfers is available in the Agreement.</p>
              <p>5.Google may, at any time and without notice, restrict, interrupt, or prevent 
                  use of the App, or delete the App from your or Customer's Android device(s), 
                  or require SpeakEng to do any of the foregoing, without entitling the Customer 
                  or you to any refund, credit, or other compensation from SpeakEng or any third 
                  party (including, but not limited to, Google or your network connectivity provider).</p>

                  Terms of Use periodically, as you are responsible for reading and complying with any 
                  amended version(s). If Customer or User objects to any such changes, Customer’s or User’s 
                  sole recourse shall be to cease using the App. Continued use of the App following the 
                  relevant Version Effective Date shall indicate Customer's and User’s acknowledgement of
